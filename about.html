        Hi there! My name is Mitra.
        </br>
        </br>
        I am a Junior at Cornell studying Information Science with concentrations in Data Science and Interactive Technologies. My passion for quantitative problem solving started at a young age, and today I have a particular interest in creating business solutions using data.
        </br>
        </br>
        Outside of school, I enjoy graphic design, spending as much time as I can in nature, spending time with animals, and trying new recipes.
